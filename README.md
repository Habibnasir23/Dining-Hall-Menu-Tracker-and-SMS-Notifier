# Dining Hall Menu Tracker and SMS Notifier
# This is the summer research project I worked on with my professor
# Developed a food recommendation system for university students using Python
# Utilized web scraping and parsing of the university dining hall website to check the menu and notify students of preferred food items via Twilio SMS API
# Incorporated user preferences with set operations for personalized recommendations
# Automated the system for daily updates and notifications before lunch and dinner
# Implemented error handling and exception management for stability
